This application note presents the method Silicon Labs uses to measure ACR on its IEEE 802.15.4-2003 compliant ICs, and compares it against other methods. Adjacent channel rejection (ACR) is an important parameter for any radio receiver. It is a measure of how well a receiver performs on its frequency channel when there is an interfering system in the vicinity operating on a nearby channel. ACR is generally one of the parameters that is used to compare the performance of different RF ICs. However, different silicon vendors use different methods for measuring ACR, which may distort performance figures.</p>
